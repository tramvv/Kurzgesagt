"You Are Immune Against Every Disease
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmpuerlbJu0

",Recognizing means that cells have countless tiny devices called receptors that are able to connect with a specific protein puzzle piece.

"You Are Immune Against Every Disease

","We know a lot of species are lost forever, just because of the environment they lived in."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","For example, lush jungles basically prevent fossilization as the chances that an animal will be buried here are low."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
",Countless scavengers of all sizes break down freshly deceased animals extremely quickly and the soil is often so acidic that bones are dissolved.
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
",And so fossils of dinosaurs from jungles are practically non-existent.
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?

",Today half of all known species live in the few remaining rainforests that only cover 2% of Earth's landmass.

","Millions of years ago when dinosaurs roamed Earth, jungles covered much more of the planet."

","It's mainly squishy gooey soft stuff, which does not preserve well."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","What remains the longest are the crystallized parts of your bones, and so most dinosaur fossils are bones or teeth."

",Usually fragments not entire skeletons.
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
",This means that almost all boneless or shellless animals are practically wiped from the fossil record.
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?

","If we take a look at the stunning diversity of weird animals like worms, jellyfish and slugs alive today, we can only speculate what we are missing."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","Although thankfully, many mostly soft and gooey species also left us an incredible diversity of shells that tell us an amazing amount about our past, so at least we have that."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?

"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","But it's not like reimagining something based on its bones is straightforward, and so the way we envisage what dinosaurs actually look like has changed a lot in the last few years."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","In the past, many illustrations had a bony minimalistic look with a toothy grin to signify fissness and danger."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","But if we draw today's animals in a similar way, based on their skeletons, just for the fun of it, we get the most bizarre creatures."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?

","Elephants, swans and baboons that look like monsters right out of nightmares."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","So similar to animals today, we should imagine dinosaurs with much more soft tissue, fatbelles or chests, weird soft parts like skin flaps, lips and gums, and just more pronounced features that would make them seem like much more pleasant fellows."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","Some soft features actually leave distinctive traces on bones that we can look for in the skeletons of extinct animals, which is where today's animals with similar features are really helpful."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
",It's a similar story with colors.
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","Because we know what the feathers of living birds look like, modern technology combined with the exceedingly rare fossils with preserved remains of fuzzy feathers, give us a glimpse of the real colors of extinct dinosaurs."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","We know that tiny sinus or objects had a striped tail, and its tiny dyno-body anchion is huxly, was white and black, with gorgeous red feathers around its head."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","Still, for the vast majority of any ancient extinct species, we have no real clue what color they were."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","But we know what modern dinosaurs birds look like, and here we find the most amazing variety."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","So some dinosaurs will have tried to blend into the background, while others might have fielded aggressive color schemes to attract mates or to appear dangerous."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
",Some might have had impressive decorations or colorful beaks.
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
",Some may have been striped or patent.
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","Similarly, we don't know that much about dinosaur behaviour, although once again we control conclusions from existing animals."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","For example, even apex predators like lions spend a lot of their time lying around and cuddling and digging each other and playing."

",Why would dinosaurs be so different?
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","When we first found the skull of T-rex with its mighty teeth, and probably the strongest bite of any land animal ever, we imagined a fierce and stupid beast."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","But modern scanning technology has revealed that T-rex had a larger brain to body ratio than some earlier giant meat eaters, and it probably had very sharp hearing, vision and a sense of smell, and was in all likelihood not a stupid animal."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
",So maybe T-rex was a cuddly fellow that spent a lot of time playing around or impressing potential mates when it was not hungry.
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","Likewise, while their horns and shields might have made serotoncits appear to be natural worn fighters, they were probably much more than that."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","Based on the behaviour of modern animals, and the complex dances some have to go through to mate, maybe their shields were amazingly colorful, maybe it does for its mates like many birds do today."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","How intensely amazing these creatures must have been, and what a lot it is to us that we don't get to experience them first hand."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQJbozY_Is
","What an even greater loss that there is so much we will never know about them and even more tragic, all the absurd and beautiful beings that disappeared without a trace."

",But such is life.

",Time marches on without any concern for our feelings and the past expands with every moment that passes.

","We can do something about that, though."
"What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?

","When they infect a viral-plasm, they just integrate their genetic code into the newly produced gyros' like sleep regions."

","Dark matter is the stuff that makes it possible for galaxies to exist, when we calculated why the universe is structured the way it is, it quickly became clear that there's just not enough normal matter."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",The gravity of the visible matter is not strong enough to form galaxies and complex structures.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","Stars would more likely be scattered all over the place and not form galaxies, so we know there is something else inside and around them."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","Something that doesn't emit or reflects light, something dark, but besides being able to calculate the existence of dark matter, we can see it kind of, places with a high concentration of dark matter, bend light passing nearby, so we know there's something there that interacts with gravity."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","Right now, we have more ideas about what dark energy is not than what it is."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","We know dark matter is not just clouds of normal matter, without stars, because it would emit particles we could detect."

","In 1929, Edwin Hubble examined how the wavelength of light emitted by distant galaxies shifts towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum as it travels through space."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","He found that, fainter, more distant galaxies showed a large degree of red shift."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","Closer galaxies, not so much."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",Hubble determined that this was because the universe itself is expanding.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",The red shift occurs because the wavelength of light are stretched as the universe expands.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",More recent discoveries have shown that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","Before that, it was thought that the pull of gravity would cause the expansion to either slow down or even retract and collapse in itself at some point."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",Space doesn't change its properties as it expands.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",There's just more of it.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",New space is constantly created everywhere.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","Galaxes are tight-bound clusters of stuff, held together by gravity, so we don't experience this expansion in our daily lives, but we see it everywhere around us."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","Wherever there is empty space in the universe, more is forming every second."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",So Dark Energy seems to be some kind of energy intrinsic to empty space.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","Energy that is stronger than anything else we know, and that keeps getting stronger as time passes by."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",Empty space has more energy than everything else in the universe combined.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",We have multiple ideas about what Dark Energy might be.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",One idea is that Dark Energy is not a thing but just a property of space.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","Empty space is not nothing, it has its own energy, it can generate more space and is quite active."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","So as the universe expands, it could be that just more and more space appears to fill the gaps and this leads to a faster expanding universe."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","This idea is close to an idea that Einstein had back in 1917 of a concept of a cosmological constant, a force that counteracted the force of gravity."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","The only problem is that when we try to calculate the amount of this energy, the result was so wrong and weird that it only added to the confusion."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","Another idea is that Empty space is actually full of temporary, virtual particles that spontaneously and continually form from nothing and then disappear into nothing again."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",The energy from those particles could be Dark Energy.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",Or maybe Dark Energy is an unknown kind of dynamic energy fluid or field which permeates the entire universe but somehow has the opposite effect on the universe than normal energy and matter.
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
","But if it exists, we don't know how and where or how we could detect it."
"What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ
",So there are still a lot of questions to answer.

","The space inside galaxies also expands, but here gravity is strong enough to keep them together."
"Three Ways to Destroy the Universe
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_aOIA-vyBo
","In the Big Rib scenario, the expansion accelerates up to a point where space expands so fast, the gravity can't compensate for this effect anymore."

"Three Ways to Destroy the Universe
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_aOIA-vyBo

","Nonetheless, only in the last 10 years has there been quite a fracking boom, especially in the USA."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
",This is because most conventional natural gas sources in America and on the European continent have been exhausted.

","Now, let's take a look at how fracking actually works."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","First, a shaft is drilled several hundred metres into the earth."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","From there, a horizontal hole is drilled into the gas bearing layer of rock."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","Next, the fracking fluid is pumped into the ground using high performance pumps."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","On average, the fluid consists of eight million litres of water, which amounts to about the daily consumption of 65,000 people, plus several thousand tons of sand and about 200,000 litres of chemicals."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
",The mixture penetrates into the rock layer and produces innumerable tiny cracks.
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
",The sand prevents the cracks from closing again.
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
",The chemicals perform various tasks.
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","Among other things, they compress the water, kill off bacteria or dissolve minerals."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","Next, the majority of the fracking fluid is pumped out again."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","And now, the natural gas can be recovered."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","As soon as the gas source is exhausted, the drill hole is sealed."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","As a rule, the fracking fluid is pumped back into deep underground layers and sealed in there."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","However, fracking is also associated with several considerable risks."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
",The primary risk consists in the contamination of drinking water sources.
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","Fracking not only consumes large quantities of fresh water, but in addition, the water is subsequently contaminated and is highly toxic."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
",The contamination is so severe that the water cannot even be cleaned in a treatment plant.
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","Even though the dangerous known and theoretically could be managed, in the USA already, sources have been contaminated due to negligence."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","No one yet knows how the enclosed water will behave in the future, since there have not yet been any long-term studies on the subject."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","The chemicals used in fracking vary from the hazardous to the extremely toxic and carcinogenic, such as benzol or formic acid."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger

",The company is using fracking say nothing about the precise composition of the chemical mixture.
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger

",But it is known that there are about 700 different chemical agents which can be used in the process.
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
",Another risk is the release of greenhouse gases.
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","The natural gas recovered by fracking consists largely of methane, a greenhouse gas which is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
",Natural gas is less harmful than coal when burned.
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","But nonetheless, the negative effects of fracking on the climate balance are overall greater."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","Firstly, the fracking process requires a very large consumption of energy."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","Secondly, the drill holes are quickly exhausted and it's necessary to drill fracking holes much more frequently than for classical natural gas wells."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","In addition, about 3% of the recovered gas is lost in the extraction and escapes into the atmosphere."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
",So how it's fracking and its expected benefits to be assessed when the advantages are balanced against the disadvantages?
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA
","When properly employed, this technique offers one way in the short-term medium term to meet our demand for lower cost energy."
"Fracking explained: opportunity or danger

"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",What exactly is the species?
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",A species is a community of animals that is capable of producing offspring with one another with those offspring also being capable of reproducing and turn.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","To understand this answer better, we need to take a closer look at the following points."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",The uniqueness of living creatures guarantee through the excess production of offspring and heresity and as a second key point selection.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",Let's begin with uniqueness.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",Every creature that exists is unique and this is essential for evolution.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","The members of a species may strongly resemble each other in appearance, however, they all have slightly different traits and characteristics."

","They may be a bit bigger, fatter, stronger or bolder than their fellow animals."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",So what is the reason for these differences?
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",Let's take a closer look at a creature.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",Every creature is made up of cells.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",These cells have a nucleus.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",The nucleus contains the chromosome.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",And the chromosomes hold the DNA.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","DNA consists of different genes, and it's these genes that are life's information carriers."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",They contain instructions and orders for the cells and determine the characteristics and traits that living creatures have.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",And it's precisely this DNA that is unique to every creature.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","It's slightly different from individual to individual, which is why each has slightly different characteristics."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",But how is the enormous range of DNA created?
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",One key factor is the excess production of offspring.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","In nature, we can observe that creatures generally produce far more offspring than is necessary for the survival of their species, with many offspring dying and early death as a result."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",Often there are even more offspring than the environment in which they live is able to support.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",This is one factor in increasing diversity within a species.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","The more offspring that are produced, the more little differences occur."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","And this is what nature wants, as many little differences as possible."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",The second major cause of the uniqueness of individuals occurs in heredity itself.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","By the way, heredity means the passing on of DNA to offspring."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",Two very interesting factors come into play in this process.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",Recommodation and mutation.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",Recommodation is the random mixing of the DNA of two creatures.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","When two creatures fall in love and mate, they recombine their genes twice."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","The first time they do this separately, when they generate the gamets, that is sperm and exels."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",The gamets take half of the genes and shuffle them.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",The second recombination occurs when in male inseminates a female.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","The parents each provide 50% of their DNA, in other words 50% of their unique traits and characteristics."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","These are then recombined or mixed, and the result is new offspring."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","These offspring have a random mix of the DNA, and therefore the traits and characteristics of their parents."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",This increases the diversity and differences within a species even further.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",But mutations are also important for evolution.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",Mutations are random changes in DNA.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","These can also be described as copying errors within the DNA, triggered by toxins or other chemical substances or by radiation."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",A mutation exists when a part of the DNA is altered.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",These changes are often negative and may result in illnesses such as cancer.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","However, they may also have neutral or positive effects such as the blue eye colour in humans, which is one such random mutation."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","In all cases, a mutation has to affect a gamet, that is a sperm or exel."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",Because only the DNA in the gamets is passed on to the offspring.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",This is also the reason why we protect our sexual organs during x-rays whilst other parts of the body are not at risk.
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
","In summary, then, in the heredity process, creatures pass on their characteristics to their offspring in the form of DNA."
"How Evolution works
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU
",Recommodation and mutation change the DNA so that each child looks different to its siblings and receives a random mix of the characteristics of its parents.
"How Evolution works
